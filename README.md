## Overview of Election Audit
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

Furthermore, as part of the Challenge, the election commission requested some additional data to complete the audit.
1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout
